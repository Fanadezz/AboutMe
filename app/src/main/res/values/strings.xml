       \nHi, around here I\'m better known as <b>GOAT</b> from my FPL
        mini-league exploits last season.


        \n\nI was born in Nyeri - Kenya to Robert and Jane and was brought
        up by my grandma
        \nAndroid programming is in my blood and I enjoy it big time. You\'ll find me
        testing apps on Android Studio and when I am tired I play FIFA or Chess Titans
        \nThe Big Bang interests me a lot and I\'m a big fun of it as it explains
        the Cosmos Origin
        \n\nI love cats
        \n\nI like brown skin gals
        \n\nMy ultimate destination is <i>Nice la Belle</i> i.e. Nice because
        \n\nNice has the vibrancy of Italy and the charm of France
        \n\nI\'m a nice guy
        \n\nYou can find me on this website
        \n\nwww.androidshowtime.com
        \n\nMy brother is called Charles
        \n\nI work as a Care Manager at 9 West in Westlands
