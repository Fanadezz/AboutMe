        Hi, I am better known as <b>GOAT</b> from my FPL mini-league exploits
        \n I was born in Nyeri - Kenya
        \n Android programming is in my blood and I enjoy it big time
        \n The Big Bang intrests me a lot
        \n I love cats
        \n I like brown skin gals
        \n My ultimate destination is <i>Nice la Belle</i> i.e. Nice because
        \n Nice has the vibrancy of Italy and the charm of France
        \n I\'m a nice guy
        \n You can find me on this website
        \n www.androidshowtime.com
